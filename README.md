# Weatherdash
A repository for an interactive weather dashboard

The purpose of this app is to provide users with an interactive dashboard to check the weather for whatever city they choose.
Just type in the name of the city you would like to visit and click submit.
You will then be taken to a display that will show the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
The UV index will also change colors depending on if it is under 3 (favorable) or greater than 3 (unfavorable).
